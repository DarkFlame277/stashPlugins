Awesome. Thank you.
Now add a feature that reads a separate, user created file called "tag_blacklist" which will have a list of user defined tags (one tag per-line). The file format for the "tag_blacklist" file should be whatever is best for the this use case. There will be only one "tag_blacklist" file used for all Stash content. This file will be present at "/data". The plugin script should treat this file as a blacklist for tags. All tags read from the JSON files should be checked against "tag_blacklist". If any tag appears in the blacklist, then it should be ignored/skipped and not added to the Stash content. Additionally, any blacklisted tags found already applied to Stash content should be removed.
